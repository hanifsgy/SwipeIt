We will do all the work of saving links and voting on them and whatnot, so you can browse and read the same way you always do. The contest will last for a fortnight from today (this thread will be stickied the whole time), after which we go to our secret hideout on Skull Island and decide which we think is the winner (or winners, if we can&amp;#39;t choose). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: disclaimer that is apparently required - do not post your questions in here.
