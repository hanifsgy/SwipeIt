Questions are asked, quite often which have seemingly nothing to do with the skills he claims to possess or the job they claim to be hiring for.\n\n- Regardless of whether he does well or poorly on the interviews, despite the fact that he's been called back for a 3rd, 4th, even 5th interview -- at some point he's simply dropped with no explanation.  Phone calls and emails are not returned.  Feedback is not provided.\n\nCan people not see how this is ultimately demoralizing and discourages people from applying for jobs?  I'll be frank and say that stories like this have discouraged me from looking for a better job.  I don't want to waste days of my time studying, traveling, talking on the phone, only to look stupid in front of my peers and be quietly rejected.\n\nI realize nobody is under obligation to coddle my insecurities, but there's a \"poisoning the well\" argument to be made here."
